### Data Source Description:
Variables were obtained from the US Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service (USDA-ERS) Food Environment Atlas. The goals of the Atlas are “to assemble statistics on food environment indicators to stimulate research on the determinants of food choices and diet quality and to provide a spatial overview of a community’s ability to access healthy food and its success in doing so. The dataset was last updated in August 2020. The full documentation and dataset are available here:
