### Data Source Description:

Variables were obtained from the US Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (USDA-NAAS) Census of Agriculture, 2017. The data were collected at the farm level and summarized at the county level for publication and mapping. The selected variables were chosen from a group of variables summarized for the Ag Census Web Maps, (https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/AgCensus/2017/Online_Resources/Ag_Census_Web_Maps/Data_download/index.php).
The full documentation and dataset for the Census of Agriculture are available [here:](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/AgCensus/2017/)
