 Syringe Services Programs (SSPs) in US counties and census zip code tabulation areas (ZCTAs). 
 All data was scraped from https://www.nasen.org/map/ and shared in a de-identified format approved by NASEN's director.

The files have a very simple set of variables.

In SSP_zcta, there are two columns:

ZCTA - Numeric 5-digit zip code
SSP_count - The number of SSPs located within that zip code


SSP_county has a similar format:

fips - 4 or 5 digit county identifier
name - County name
state - County state
SSP_count - The number of SSPs located within that county
